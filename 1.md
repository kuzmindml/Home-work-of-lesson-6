When you duplicate an invoice, Stripe copies all of the information on the original invoice except for credit notes, deleted (or archived) products, prices, coupons, discounts, and tax rates. If you made a mistake on an invoice you already created, duplicate it, make your corrections, and then send the new invoice. Remember to [void](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/overview#void "") the incorrect invoice as well.

### Invoice receipts
Stripe creates receipts when a customer pays an invoice, or makes any [subscription]("") payment.

After payment, the [Hosted Invoice Page](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page "") includes a link to a receipt that a customer can download for their own records. You can also manually send a receipt by clicking the __Send receipt__ button on the __Invoice details__ page. To email yourself a test receipt, go to your [Branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=%2Fsettings%2Fbranding "") and hover over the email receipt to see the __Send test receipt__ button. To learn more about email receipts, see [Email receipts](https://stripe.com/docs/receipts "").
